    <h1>Git and GitHub</h1>
    <h2>What is Git?</h2>
    <p>
      Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in
      source code.
    </p>
    <p>
      It allows developers to save different versions of their code, collaborate
      with others, and recover previous versions if something goes wrong.
    </p>
    <h3>Why Git is Important?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tracks complete history of code changes</li>
      <li>Helps multiple developers work on the same project</li>
      <li>Prevents code loss and mistakes</li>
      <li>Makes collaboration easier and safer</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Common Git Commands</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>git init – Initialize a new Git repository</li>
      <li>git clone &lt;url&gt; – Clone an existing repository</li>
      <li>git status – Check current status</li>
      <li>git add . – Stage all changes</li>
      <li>git commit -m "message" – Save changes with message</li>
      <li>git push – Upload changes to remote repository</li>
      <li>git pull – Fetch and merge remote changes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It allows
      developers to store code online, collaborate with others, track issues,
      review code, and deploy projects.
    </p>
    <h3>Why GitHub is Used?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Online backup of code</li>
      <li>Collaboration with teams</li>
      <li>Showcase projects to recruiters</li>
      <li>Supports CI/CD and deployment</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Difference Between Git and GitHub</h3>
    <p>Git is a version control tool</p>
    <p>GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories</p>
    <h3>What is a Repository?</h3>
    <p>
      A repository (repo) is a storage location where project files and their
      history are stored. It can be local or remote.
    </p>
    <h3>Branches in Git</h3>
    <p>
      A branch is a separate line of development. The main branch usually
      contains stable code, while other branches are used for new features or
      fixes.
    </p>
    <h3>What is Commit?</h3>
    <p>
      A commit is a snapshot of changes made to the project. Each commit has a
      unique ID and a message describing the change.
    </p>
    <h3>What is CI/CD in GitHub?</h3>
    <p>
      CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. GitHub
      supports CI/CD using GitHub Actions, which automatically builds, tests,
      and deploys projects whenever code is pushed.
    </p>
    <h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
    <p>
      GitHub Pages allows developers to host static websites directly from a
      GitHub repository. It is commonly used for portfolios and documentation
      sites.
    </p>
    <h3>Importance of Git & GitHub for Frontend Developers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Manages project versions</li>
      <li>Helps in team collaboration</li>
    </ul>
