<!--# Git and GitHub
***What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code.
It allows developers to save different versions of their code, collaborate with others, and recover previous versions if something goes wrong.

- Why Git is Important?
Tracks complete history of code changes
Helps multiple developers work on the same project
Prevents code loss and mistakes
Makes collaboration easier and safer

-Common Git Commands
git init – Initialize a new Git repository
git clone <url> – Clone an existing repository
git status – Check current status
git add . – Stage all changes
git commit -m "message" – Save changes with message
git push – Upload changes to remote repository
git pull – Fetch and merge remote changes

***What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It allows developers to store code online, collaborate with others, track issues, review code, and deploy projects.

Why GitHub is Used?
Online backup of code
Collaboration with teams
Showcase projects to recruiters
Supports CI/CD and deployment

What is a Repository?
A repository (repo) is a storage location where project files and their history are stored. It can be local or remote.

Branches in Git
A branch is a separate line of development. The main branch usually contains stable code, while other branches are used for new features or fixes.

What is Commit?
A commit is a snapshot of changes made to the project. Each commit has a unique ID and a message describing the change.

What is CI/CD in GitHub?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. GitHub supports CI/CD using GitHub Actions, which automatically builds, tests, and deploys projects whenever code is pushed.

GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages allows developers to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. It is commonly used for portfolios and documentation sites.
